Lots of testing lots of trial an error. This repo is a compilation of my projects. 
I will be experimenting with the FastAI library by applying deep learning to idustries in my domain of expertese. These include:
  - Supply chain
  - Human Resources
  - food production
 
 
These models are made with the intention to be deployable at scale.
